# SCT_DS_4


During my internship at SkillCraft Technology, I successfully completed Task 4.

Excited to Share My Learning Journey! 

Over the past few weeks, I've been exploring data analysis and visualization techniques using Python, working with large datasets like [Dataset Name/Details, e.g., US Accidents Dataset]. This has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to practice key skills such as:

✅ Data Cleaning and Transformation  
✅ Statistical Analysis and Correlation  
✅ Advanced Visualizations with Seaborn and Plotly  
✅ Insights into Weather Conditions and Their Impact  

Here are some of the key visualizations and insights I developed:  
- A heatmap showcasing accidents by hour and weather condition.  
- A correlation matrix revealing patterns between weather features and accident severity.  
- Distribution and trend analysis of key numeric variables.  

I'm enthusiastic about applying these skills in real-world projects and collaborating with professionals in the industry. If you're working on data-driven initiatives or have advice for an aspiring analyst, I'd love to connect and learn from you!
